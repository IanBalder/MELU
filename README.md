Overview

Project Name is a [brief description of your project]. It provides [specific functionality or purpose]. This application can be run using make or Docker for an efficient development and deployment workflow.
Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

    Make: Install via your package manager (e.g., apt install make, brew install make).
    Docker: Install Docker.
    (Optional) Docker Compose: Install Docker Compose.
    Node.js (if needed): Install Node.js.

Setup

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
cd repository

(Optional) Set up environment variables:

    Copy the example environment file:

        cp .env.example .env

        Update .env with your configuration details.

Usage
With make

Use make commands to streamline running the project. Common commands include:

    Build the project:

make build

Run the application:

make run

Stop the application:

make stop

Clean up (remove containers, volumes, etc.):

    make clean

Customize these commands based on your Makefile.
With Docker

Alternatively, you can manage the project directly with Docker:

    Build the Docker images:

docker-compose build

Run the application:

docker-compose up

Stop the application:

    docker-compose down

    Access the application:
        Frontend: http://localhost:8080
        Backend: http://localhost:5000

API Documentation (if applicable)

For API projects, provide details on endpoints, request formats, and response formats. Include an example:

Example Endpoint:

    GET /api/users

Response:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "johndoe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
  }
]

Troubleshooting

    Issue: vue-cli-service: not found
        Ensure node_modules is correctly installed by running npm install in the frontend directory.

    Issue: db module not found
        Verify the Python module structure and ensure the PYTHONPATH includes the appropriate directories.

    Containers fail to start
        Check if ports 5000, 5432, and 8080 are in use and stop conflicting services:

        sudo lsof -i :5000
        kill -9 <PID>
